<h2 class="giga">Breakpoints</h2>

<hr/>

<div class="editor">

    <p>Breakpoints are the viewport widths that the media queries use to identify when to load specific CSS styles.</p>

    <p>These were usually set at various approximate screen widths for various devices, but as screen sizes have changed, this no longer makes sense, and the breakpoints tend to be chosen based on how the content is displayed in the system.</p>

    <p>The designer will set the breakpoints dependant on the flow of the content and how it is displayed in the viewport width. Once the content on the screen is too cramped, or feels too loose, a breakpoint can be added to allow the designer to add new CSS rules once tha viewport size becomes wider than the identified breakpoint width.</p>

    <p>By default, the standard breakpoints are as follows:</p>

    <table class="table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th></th>
                <th>Small<br><small>min-width 420px</th>
                <th>Medium<br><small>min-width 660px</th>
                <th>Large<br><small>min-width 960px</th>
                <th>Extra Large<br><small>min-width 1200px</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td class="font-bold">Class suffix</th>
                <td><pre>--small</pre></td>
                <td><pre>--medium</pre></td>
                <td><pre>--large</pre></td>
                <td><pre>--xlarge</pre></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
