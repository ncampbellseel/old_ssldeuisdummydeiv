                <h2>Vision</h2>
                <p>The Style Guide is to provide a consistent reference guide for developers working on the [project name] project. </p>
                <p>The vision of the guide is to provide a document that identifies the most appropriate technologies, libraries, methods and styling to use for the project, and how to they can be used consistently throughout the project.</p>
                <h3>Recommended Technologies</h3>
                <h4>Java</h4>
                <p>Although not touched on in this document, the underlying structure of the system is to be built on java framework. This is identified here, as it has influenced the choice of technologies and libraries to be used throughout the system.</p>
                <h4>HTML5</h4>
                <p>HTML for the project should be written and produced programmatically as HTML5 that aligns to the standard as set out by the W3C guidelines.</p>
                <h4>SASS</h4>
                <p>To encourage rapid development, a front end compiler is used. SASS allows CSS to be written programmatically, using variables, procedures (mixins) and logic such as loops and statements.</p>
                <p>SASS requires to be complied into a single CSS file before the content can become usable. There are a number of ways to compile SASS to output usable CSS such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#">SASS in the terminal</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Koala [link to site]</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>SASS can also be run in scaffolding programs such as Gulp or Grunt, if available.</p>
                <h4>CSS3</h4>
                <p>The CSS generated by the SASS output should align to the standard set out for CSS3 by the W3C. It should be mentioned that an understanding of the browsers that the system is being created for is required so that any CSS styling that does not work on older versions of browsers degrades gracefully and does not break the styling of the system.</p>
                <h3>Libraries</h3>
                <h4>jQuery</h4>
                <p>In order to have a consistent style for writing and using JavaScript, the jQuery JavaScript library is recommended. jQuery provides a large library of methods and functions that supports concise and powerful JavaScript. </p>
                <h4>Primefaces</h4>
                <p>A Java based component library that outputs the required components as standard compliant HTML5. This Primefaces library will be used for all functionality available in the application, and is generated automatically by Java directly into the HMTL templates. </p>
                <h4>GDS Style Guide</h4>
                <p>As this project is to be based on the GDS style, both technical and visual, we have included and referenced the GDS visual style guide in the CSS.</p>
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <h4>Abstracted CSS Classes</h4>
                <p>To keep classes and styles consistent and extendable, the CSS classes have been abstracted from the HTML elements as much as possible. The style guide has been created in such a way that a developer may create fully functioning and stylistically consistent templates using only HTML with the associated CSS classes applied. </p>
                <p>These classes are written to be consistent and human readable using the BEM naming convention.</p>
                <p>Along with the regular modifiers that are added to the CSS classes using the ‘--modifier’ pattern, responsive modifiers are also added at the end of the class names, so that ‘--large’ means that the styles for that class will only be implemented above the ‘large’ breakpoint.</p>
                <h4>Editor Classes</h4>
                <p>The only html elements that have CSS styles set on them as standard are those that are displayed within a div of class ‘editor’. This class exists to allow for the presentation of long form user generated content such as reports or posts. The elements within this class are mostly of a typographical nature.</p>
                <h3>Visual Design</h3>
                <p>As a government based project, the visual style is based on that of the GDS design guidelines. These guidelines provide a consistent visual baseline for web sites and applications to align their design. </p>
