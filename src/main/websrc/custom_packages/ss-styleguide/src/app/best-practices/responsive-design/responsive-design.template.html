    <h3 class="heading mega">Mobile First Design</h3>

    <p class="push--top">When creating sites that are designed to respond to the the device on which they are being displayed, it is common best practice to design 'mobile first', or using a small screen to large screen methodology. This allows the designer to initally concentrate on the hierachical structure of the information, so that the most important, or useful, information is displayed in a prominant area.</p>

    <h4 class="heading kilo">Why design for mobile users?</h4>

    <p class="push--top">Mobile device's have been outselling dektop and laptop computer for years. More users access web services now than ever before, and this is a trend that is continuing to grow. As more users access these services on their devices, they expect that the services will be optimise to run on their device.</p>
    <p class="push--top">There are a number of solutions to achieve this, but the most widely used and supported solution is the responsive approach to web design.</p>

    <h4 class="heading kilo">Fluid and Breakpoints</h4>

    <p class="push--top">Responsive design works by using percentage values for setting widths of elements so that they stretch to fill areas of the screen and responds to the overall width of the viewport. Media queries are also used to call various CSS styles that are used specifically above the designated screen widths set in the media queries.</p>
